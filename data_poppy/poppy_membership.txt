Poppy Membership: The Poppy Membership is an annual program that allows patients to pay for dental care services at a discounted rate. It is a good option for individuals who do not have dental insurance, as it does not have a maximum annual limit on coverage. The membership offers savings on the cost of two routine dental visits per year, and as an added benefit, it includes a discount on other dental services.
