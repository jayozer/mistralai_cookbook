Q: What types of preventative dental care does Poppy Kids Pediatric Dentistry offer?
A: At Poppy Kids Pediatric Dentistry, our preventative care services are designed to maintain your child's oral health and prevent dental diseases. These services include: Dental Cleanings and Exams: Dr. Andrea conducts comprehensive exams to evaluate your child?s risk for cavities, check for dental decay, and discuss treatment options as needed. Our focus is on education and prevention. Fluoride Treatments: We use a special fluoride varnish available in various flavors that is Big 8 allergen-free, gluten-free, dye-free, and made in the USA. This treatment strengthens tooth enamel and fights dental decay. Dental Radiographs (X-rays): Utilizing the latest digital radiography, we offer both intraoral and extraoral X-rays to diagnose dental diseases and assess growth and development with minimal radiation exposure.
Sealants: To protect the deep grooves and fissures in your child's molars from decay, we apply a thin layer of resin material as a sealant.

Q: Can you explain more about the fluoride treatments you offer?
A: Certainly! Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that helps in desensitizing teeth and fighting dental decay by strengthening the enamel. At our office, we recommend a topical fluoride varnish every six months to provide an extra strength boost to your child?s teeth. Our fluoride varnish is tailored for kids, offering great-tasting flavors, and is safe for those with common allergies.

Q: What is Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF), and when is it used?
A: Silver Diamine Fluoride (SDF) is a minimally invasive treatment that stops dental decay from progressing further. It's especially useful for children who may find traditional dental treatments challenging. SDF can serve as a temporary solution until more definitive treatment can be performed.

Q: How do digital X-rays at Poppy Kids Pediatric Dentistry benefit my child?
A: Digital X-rays are a critical tool for diagnosing dental issues and evaluating your child?s oral growth and development. They use up to 90% less radiation than traditional film X-rays and are environmentally friendly. Depending on your child's needs, Dr. Andrea may recommend intraoral X-rays for detailed views of individual teeth or extraoral X-rays, like a panorex, to assess overall dental health, growth, and development.

Q: What are dental sealants and how do they work?
A: Dental sealants are a preventative treatment used to protect molars from decay. Molars have deep grooves that can trap food and plaque, making them susceptible to cavities. Sealants are a flowable resin material applied to these grooves to seal them off and prevent decay. They are an effective measure for keeping your child's teeth healthy.

Q: What is a frenectomy, and when is it needed?
A: A frenectomy is a procedure to remove or adjust the frenum, a connective tissue membrane that attaches one part of the mouth to another. In pediatric dentistry, it's often performed when the lingual (under the tongue) or labial (under the lip) frenum restricts movement, which can affect speech, eating, or the positioning of teeth. This procedure helps in improving the range of motion and can alleviate related issues

Q: What are white fillings, and why are they used?
A: White fillings are used to treat dental decay by restoring the form and function of the tooth. Poppy Kids Pediatric Dentistry opts for esthetic, BPA-free white fillings for smaller cavities, enhancing each patient's smile while maintaining health standards. These fillings are preferred for their aesthetics, blending seamlessly with natural teeth, and for being free from Bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical of concern to some health professionals. The choice of filling material should be informed by considering various factors like durability and aesthetics.

Q: When is a crown recommended for a child's tooth?
A: A crown is recommended in cases where tooth decay has affected a large area, making it impossible for a white filling to be effective. Poppy Kids Pediatric Dentistry offers both white and silver crowns to cater to the individual needs of each patient. Crowns are necessary when the structural integrity of the tooth is compromised, providing strength and preventing further decay or damage.

Q: What is pulp therapy, and when is it needed?
A: Pulp therapy is a dental procedure aimed at saving a severely decayed baby tooth. This treatment is considered when decay reaches the nerve of the tooth. It involves placing a medicinal treatment inside the tooth's root to promote healing from within. The primary goal is to preserve the tooth until it can fall out naturally, as baby teeth play a crucial role in a child's oral development, including chewing and holding space for permanent teeth.

Q: What are the reasons for extracting a primary baby tooth?
A: Dr. Andrea may recommend the extraction of a primary baby tooth for several reasons, including if the adult tooth has emerged while the baby tooth remains, an orthodontist suggests extraction to improve the alignment of permanent teeth, trauma to the tooth, extensive decay with infection, or if a child is in discomfort and unable to naturally lose the tooth. Extractions are performed with the aim to maintain oral health and facilitate the proper development of permanent teeth.

Q: What are space maintainers, and why might my child need one?
A: Space maintainers are intraoral appliances used to preserve the gap left by a prematurely lost primary baby molar. These devices are critical in situations where the permanent successor is not yet ready to erupt, preventing potential crowding by keeping the space open. Space maintainers ensure the proper alignment of permanent teeth by preventing neighboring teeth from shifting into the vacant space, thus facilitating a smoother transition to adult dentition.

Q: What is nitrous oxide and how is it used in pediatric dentistry?
A: Nitrous oxide, commonly referred to as "laughing gas," is a mild sedative used to help children relax during dental procedures. It's delivered through a small mask over the nose, offering a pleasant and calming experience without putting the child to sleep. The gas is odorless, and at Poppy Kids Pediatric Dentistry, we provide disposable masks with fun scents like bubblegum, strawberry, and grape to make the experience even more enjoyable for kids. After the procedure, children breathe pure oxygen for about 5 minutes to flush any remaining gas, allowing them to return to their normal activities quickly.

Q: What is general anesthesia, and when is it recommended for children?
A: General anesthesia (GA) is a more profound form of sedation where the child is completely asleep and unaware of the dental procedure. It's typically reserved for comprehensive dental care that may be extensive or invasive, ensuring a completely pain-free and comfortable experience for the child. GA is administered by trained anesthesia providers, with vital signs closely monitored throughout the procedure. It's particularly beneficial for children who may find it difficult to cooperate during lengthy treatments or for those with special healthcare needs. Poppy Kids Pediatric Dentistry collaborates with Bay Anesthesia, a team known for its safety and expertise, to provide this service.

Q: How safe is sedation dentistry for children?
A: Sedation dentistry is considered safe for children when administered by experienced and trained professionals. Whether using nitrous oxide or general anesthesia, the dental team at Poppy Kids Pediatric Dentistry takes every precaution to ensure your child's safety and comfort. Vital signs and overall well-being are closely monitored during any procedure involving sedation. Additionally, collaboration with specialized anesthesiology teams like Bay Anesthesia underscores our commitment to the highest safety standards.

Q: Can my child return to school or daily activities after receiving nitrous oxide?
A: After receiving nitrous oxide, children can typically return to school or other daily activities immediately. The effects of nitrous oxide wear off within minutes after the mask is removed, as children are given pure oxygen to breathe for a short period post-treatment. This quick recovery time is one of the advantages of choosing nitrous oxide for dental sedation in children.
